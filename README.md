# Bank churners project
Welcome to the Credit Card Customer Attrition Analysis repository!

# Overview
In this project, I worked with a public dataset extracted from Kaggle.com, which can be found  here. in the next link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/data. The objective was to understand the characteristics of customers who were leaving the bank's services and to create a multiple regression model that predicts the probability of a customer leaving the bank based on certain significant variables. The dataset comprised over 10,000 observations and 21 variables.

# Tools Used
-Data Cleaning and Exploratory Analysis: The data cleaning and exploratory analysis were conducted using BigQuery.
-Visualizations: Visualizations were created using Tableau to gain insights into the dataset and communicate findings effectively.
-Multiple Regression Model Building: The multiple regression model was built using R Studio to analyze the relationship between various predictors and customer attrition.
-Presentation: The project findings were presented using Canva to create a visually appealing and informative presentation.
